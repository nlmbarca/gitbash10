Recap -

What is framework?
    - It gives us an organized folder structure to follow while writing the code.

    Benefits of framework:
        - it increases code reusability, readability, easy to maintain

    What is Maven:
        - it is a build automation tool that helps us manage dependencies,
        create project structure/hierarchy, and execute our test cases

        -Maven can be used primarily for java applications, but we can also work in
        other languages

        How does maven manage the dependencies?
            - Maven has a central repository where we have all the jar files
            instead of adding them manually we can simply add them in our pom.xml and
            maven takes care of it automatically

    What is pom.xml?
        - configuration file for our project
        to contain all the dependencies we need from maven repository

    What is testNG?
        - testing automation framework

        annotations:
        1.@Test -> marks the method as test method
        2.@Before -> preconditions (suite,test,method,class)
        3.@After -> postconditons (suite,test,method,class)

    what is our xml file?
        - configuration file for testNG

        <suite>
          <test>
             <classes>
                <class name="">
                   <methods>
                      <include name=""/>
                   </methods>
                </class>
             </classes>
          </test>

          <test>
             <classes>
             </classes>
          </test>
        </suite>

Class 6 TestNgFramework

User stories - 12345 - user should be able to login via valid credentials

US - 87978 - Admin user should be able to add an employee to the hrms application

US - 34342 - System should display error messages when invalid login is performed

1. when user enter valid/invalid username and valid/invalid password then display "Invalid credentials"

2. when user leaves password field empty then display "Password cannot be empty"

3. when user leaves username field empty then display "Username cannot be empty"

Maven - build automation tool

Testng - tool for testing
        to group all test cases
        to perform batch testing
        to get reports

POM - design pattern
        to maintain page element
        we create separate java class for every page

DataDrivenTesting(DDT) - testing the same functionality across multiple/different sets of data
                        Using @DataProvider and excel

   .xls =HSSFWorkbook
   .xlsx (newer) = XSSFWorkbook

Class 7 TestNgFramework

Recap -

volume of data - if it is big, data provider cannot handle this
